                            Don't Panic is an affordable, effective treatment tool for patients who suffer from anxiety disorders such as phobias and PTSD. Numerous studies demonstrate the efficacy of exposure-based treatments in treating phobic fears and avoidance behaviors compared to traditional methods. Some distinct advantages are that stimuli and complex situations can be safely managed, paused, and repeated several times. Not only can disadvantaged patients save transportation costs, but they can purchase a relatively cheap VR device that works with their smartphone and fitness tracker to conquer phobias in the comfort of their homes.

                            Approximately the same number of Americans are affected by PTSD or specific phobias (25 million) as people diagnosed with diabetes. These phobias are often debilitating and require numerous visits to the doctor's office and long-term treatment in order to conquer. We have created an immersive virtual reality (VR) solution to bring treatment into the patient's home using Google Cardboard, a smart phone, and a wearable device (Fitbit, Apple Watch, Microsoft Band 2, Polar H7, etc.)- all more commonly accessible items today. This low-cost option can help patients work on their phobias in incremental exposures, and ultimately lead to a state of mastery in which they are no longer paralyzed. Cognitive behavioral therapy in the regular clinical setting can involve the patient imagining the phobia (bombshells exploding, plane rides, fear of heights, fear of spiders), which results in their physiological “fight-or-flight” response being elicited. Biosensors can be used during these sessions, in addition to auditory and visual aids… but our solution, Don't Panic, brings treatment to a new level.

                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">
                            Based on the phobia/trauma, a virtual environment can be personalized for the patient. This immersive virtual reality simulation integrates auditory, visual, and haptic inputs that are meant to evoke the patient's fear response. A wearable device worn by the patient will provide real-time heart rate data displayed within the VR environment so that the patient can immediately monitor his progress. A pre-programmed physician or remote physician rendered into the 3D VR environment in real-time can guide the patient through relaxing, meditative, or mental techniques that enable the patient to slowly take control over his autonomic fight or flight response that can be triggered without warning. Exposures to his worst fears through varying degrees of severity can allow mastery of the tools needed to gain control. The heart rate data collected during each session is stored in a cloud service and analyzed to provide feedback on physiological states during the virtual simulation (e.g., how long it took to elicit the fear response, and how quickly the phobia was conquered). Our approach allows not only immediate feedback, but also provides a quantitative way to examine progress (vs. the traditional qualitative methods). Data from multiple users can be analyzed as Big Data in the Internet of Things (IoT) and used to further improve future simulations and administrations of this therapy option. Augmented reality and further options can be added to continually enhance and improve the experience and treatment.
